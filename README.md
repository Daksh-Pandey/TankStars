# TankStars
### Tech-stack:
* Java
* LibGDX

This game was designed in Java using [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/). It is based on the popular mobile game TankStars 
([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playgendary.tanks)/[iOS])(https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tank-stars/id1347123739). This is not a complete
render of the mobile game. We have only implemented clickable buttons (forked from [gdx-skins/glassy](https://github.com/Daksh-Pandey/gdx-skins/tree/master/glassy) and
Physics2d module in tank fighting.

This project was made by me and [@Shivam Yadav](https://github.com/hyphenXY).
